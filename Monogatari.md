***************************************************************************************************************
NOTE:	Many of the releases I link here will be from [[Kawaiika-Raws]](https://nyaa.si/user/DeadNews)

Meaning that you'll need to either install the fonts provided with the release on your system or mux them into 
the video file yourself for the subtitiles to display properly. If you don't, they will be rendered incorrectly.

How to install fonts: 

- If you're using MPV player to play the files (highly highly recommended), install them into MPV itself. To do this:
		1. Create a new folder inside the mpv folder, name it "fonts"
		2. Dump all fonts that come with any release in there.
		3. Profit.

Here's a link to the modified MPV player I use: https://github.com/Moodkiller/MPV-Made-Easy (Windows, unsure if it's mac compatible)

For Mac, you might want to get the unmodded player from the official website: https://mpv.io/installation/


 Any other player (MPC is popular):
 - Windows: just select all fonts-> right click -> install -> (done).
 - Mac: Seems to be a matter of selecting and double-clicking on them, see https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201749 (I've never used Mac)

 VLC is known to render some formats (both videos and font-based typesetting) incorrectly but I don't know the specific conditions or if it happens with anything I linked here. Just a heads-up if you want to use it.
***************************************************************************************************************


--- A while back someone uploaded a full compilation of the show [here](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744) and many other compilations popped up since. Just look up "Monogatari series" on nyaa 
and you'll see them. But I belive many of their subs choices weren't the best. Their videos were okay (Beatrice is very good), but I didn't like some of the modified subs they chose. 



-- So take these instead:


## 1. Bakemonogatari: [ANE](https://nyaa.si/view/256450)
   * (Optional) replace EPs 1-2 with [MTBB's](https://nyaa.si/view/1260802) (TL closer to Vertical's novel translation + better video quality than ANE) -- MTBB used VCB/mawen videos here which are generally very good.


## 2. Kizumonogatari Trilogy has three options: 
* [EDO](https://nyaa.si/view/1073285) (my recommendation)
* [Commie](https://nyaa.si/view/1073285) 
* [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1141748) (has Commie subs but different and likely better video)
*   or [Yurei](https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=0_0&q=Y%C5%ABrei+Kizumonogatari+) if you're lazy | Different Video (unsure about quality). Included both Edo and Commie subs + includes official subs(not good translation)
	
	>Note: I prefer Edo subs for Kizu but it's up to you to choose. Commie may possibly have terminology and phrasing more consistent with other entries since many releases use their subs as base such as Second Season and NekoKuro.


## 3. Nisemonogatari: [FLFL](https://nyaa.si/view/1400535) - Kawaiika-Raws video + MTBB(ep1) + Commie + Coalgirls for the rest of the tracks with additional minor tl & ts fixes to all tracks.
   * or [Tap24](https://nyaa.si/view/1103251) -- has VCB video.
   * or [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1163419) -- has Tap24 subs. (I don't remember if I compared Nise videos yet)


## 4. Nekomonogatari:Kuro(Black): 
[Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1163420) (has Commie subs)

in case anything breaks with their release (unlikely), you can download Commie's original (and 8 years old) release [here](https://nyaa.si/view/424165)	or just take it from this [compilation](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744) but it will be (slightly?) inferior to Kawaiika visually with possibly (slightly?) modified subs.


## 5. Monogatari: Second Season:  same as Neko, take it from here [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1163288) (doesn't include Hanamonogatari)
    
Monogatrai Second Season contains the arcs:

1. NekomonogatariShiro
2. Kabukimonogatari
3. Hanamonogatari
4. Otorimonogatari
5. Onimonogatari
6. Koimonogatari

* Hanamonogatari: [FLFL](https://nyaa.si/view/1394773) - Contains Kawaiika-Raws video + Commie subs + Commentary tracks and their translations
* or [Commie's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/1001039)
* or from this [compilation](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744)
                 
    keep in mind that you should watch Hana in the middle of Monogatari: Second Season.

	>Also note:	In the broadcast version, EP6 & 11 & 16 are recaps which this torrent and most out there don't include.
	
    Hana comes right after Kabukimonogatari and before Otorimonogatari(Nadeko arc). 
    
    * So without counting recaps, Hana is after EP9 and before EP10
    * With counting recpas, Hana is after EP11 and before EP12
																						
    In other words, **Hanamonogatari is the third arc in Monogatari Second Season**.
    ____________________________________________________________________



7. ## Tsukimonogatari: [FLFL](https://nyaa.si/view/1394774) - Contains Kawaiika-Raws video + Commie subs + Commentary tracks and their translations
	* or [Commie's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/739772)


8. ## Koyomimonogatari:
* Episodes 01-06 [Commie](https://nyaa.si/view/1246528) (seems to be based on Sajamba from what I compared, revised + Better Typesetting)
* Episodes 07-12 [Sajamba](https://nyaa.si/view/835714)
* (optional but it's very short) [Koyomi History](https://nyaa.si/view/1141750) -- short "story" included in the BD of Koyomimonogatari to be watched/read after Koyomimonogatari.
		
		
9. ## Owarimonogatari: [FLFL](https://nyaa.si/view/1395195) - Contains Kawaiika-Raws video + Commie subs + Commentary tracks and their translations
	 * or [Commie's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/1011605) | Note: Commie's release is missing one font that you can patch in with this [patch](https://commiesubs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/owari_patches.zip).


10. ## Owarimonogatari S2: [FLFL](https://nyaa.si/view/1396317) -- Kawaiika-Raws video + StoryTime + ToishY for convenience.

Or if for some reason you don't want [FLFL] (why???), you could go with these ***obselete options***:

* The best video that you can easily obtain is probably [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1137467) | but the included subs are outdated, so get [StoryTime]'s subs for EPs 1-2 from [here](https://kitsunekko.net/subtitles/Owarimonogatari%20S02%20(2017)/[Storytime]%20Owarimonogatari%20(Ge)%20Mayoi%20Hell%20subs.zip) and use it with Kawaiika-Raws.
* EPs 3-7 subs can be taken from [ToishY], though not ideal, it is the best out there for the rest of [Owari2](https://mega.nz/file/07oRGYTJ#DKxB9zKqVj4X_LzHwIU0mcw4ZWW2VMppkMwkNugsHWg)
			
 * If you're lazy, just get EPs 1&2 from [StoryTime](https://nyaa.si/view/1231415) and the rest from [ToishY'a release from here](https://nyaa.si/view/1178566), but their video quality is likely noticeably inferior to Kawaiika-Raws.


11. ## Zoku Owarimonogatari: [[Arid]](https://nyaa.si/view/1395216) - Contains Kawaiika-Raws + Both Edo & MTBB subs tracks for your convenience to switch between.

[MTBB's TL notes if you're interested](https://pastebin.com/JnQSCG9M), very interesting read into the wordplay in Zoku (read it after).

Or if for some reason you don't want Arid (why???), you could go with these ***obselete options***:

* If you're not lazy get [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1134728) and use Edo's subs with it from [here](https://kitsunekko.net/subtitles/Zoku%20Owarimonogatari/[Edo]%20Zoku%20Owarmonogarai.zip)
* [Edo](https://nyaa.si/user/EdoPhantom?f=0&c=0_0&q=zoku) (same person who did Kizu, I prefer this script but MTBB has strong points as well)
* [MTBB's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/1138570) (can't go wrong with it, I just like Edo's prose). I know it's 720p but if you run an okay upscaler with MPV it'll look close to the best (Kawaiika-Raws). For more info on upscaling with mpv, check [this blogpost](https://iamscum.wordpress.com/guides/videoplayback-guide/mpv-conf/) after installing [MPV-Made-Easy](https://github.com/Moodkiller/MPV-Made-Easy) or any other version of the software.

	>Note: Rereading MTBB's TL notes, I'm starting to lean towards their release a little for some episodes. Hard for me to judge now. I watched both when they were released but it's been a long while, will probably need a new full rewatch to properly compare. Ideally, I'd create a mix of both scripts if I had the time, since both had very creative wordplay localisation ideas. You might do well to watch Edo's release then read MTBB's TL notes if you don't want to stress too much about the differences. Also you could always rewatch.

**AGAIN, IF THE RELEASE YOU DOWNLOADED HAS A FONTS FOLDER, DON'T FORGET TO INSTALL THE FONTS FROM IT!**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***Final note: 
If you get confused, it's alright to take the entries from this full [compilation](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744)
but not all of them have the best subs so that might be a problem if you're picky like me. Make sure to follow the watch order!
