***************************************************************************************************************
NOTE:	Many of the releases I link here will be from [[Kawaiika-Raws]](https://nyaa.si/user/DeadNews)

Meaning that you'll need to either install the fonts provided with the release on your system or mux them into 
the video file yourself for the subtitiles to display properly. If you don't, they will be rendered incorrectly.

How to install fonts: 

- If you're using MPV player to play the files (as you should), install them into MPV itself. To do this:
		1. Create a new folder inside the mpv folder, name it "fonts"
		2. Dump all fonts that come with any release in there.
		3. Profit.

Here's a link to the modified MPV player I use: https://github.com/Moodkiller/MPV-Made-Easy


- Any other player (MPC is popular): Just select all fonts-> right click -> install -> (done).
***************************************************************************************************************


--- A while back someone uploaded a full compilation of the show [here](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744) and many other compilations popped up since. Just look up "Monogatari series" on nyaa 
and you'll see them. But I belive many of their subs choices weren't the best. Their videos were okay (Beatrice is very good), but I didn't like some of the modified subs they chose. 



-- So take these instead:


## 1. Bakemonogatari: [ANE](https://nyaa.si/view/256450)
   * (Optional) replace EPs 1-2 with [MTBB's](https://nyaa.si/view/1260802) (TL closer to Vertical's novel translation + better video quality than ANE) -- MTBB uses VCB/mawen videos which are generally very good


## 2. Kizumonogatari Trilogy has three options: 
* [EDO](https://nyaa.si/view/1073285) (my recommendation)
* [Commie](https://nyaa.si/view/1073285) 
* [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1141748) (same subs as Commie but different and likely better video)
*   or [Yurei](https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=0_0&q=Y%C5%ABrei+Kizumonogatari+) | Different Video. Included both Edo and Commie subs + includes official subs(not good)
	
	Note: I prefer Edo subs for Kizu but it's up to you to choose. Commie may possibly have terminology and phrasing more consistent with other entries since many releases use their subs as base such as Second Season and NekoKuro.


## 3. Nisemonogatari: [Tap24](https://nyaa.si/view/1103251)


## 4. Nekomonogatari:Kuro(Black): 
[Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1163420) (has Commie subs)

in case anything breaks with their release (unlikely), you can download Commie's original (and 8 years old) release [here](https://nyaa.si/view/424165)	or just take it from this [compilation](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744) but it will be (slightly?) inferior to Kawaiika visually with possibly (slightly?) modified subs.


## 5. Monogatari: Second Season:  same as Neko, take it from here [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1163288) (doesn't include Hanamonogatari)
    
Monogatrai Second Season contains the arcs:

1. NekomonogatariShiro
2. Kabukimonogatari
3. Hanamonogatari
4. Otorimonogatari
5. Onimonogatari
6. Koimonogatari

* Hanamonogatari: [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1145617)
* or [Commie's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/1001039)
* or from this [compilation](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744)
                 
    keep in mind that you should watch Hana in the middle of Monogatari: Second Season.

	Also note:	In the broadcast version, EP6 & 11 & 16 are recaps which this torrent and most out there don't include.
	
    Hana comes right after Kabukimonogatari and before Otorimonogatari(Nadeko arc). 
    
    * So without counting recaps, Hana is after EP9 and before EP10
    * With counting recpas, Hana is after EP11 and before EP12
																						
    In other words, **Hanamonogatari is the third arc in Monogatari Second Season**.
    ____________________________________________________________________



7. ## Tsukimonogatari: [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1145618)
	* or [Commie's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/739772)


8. ## Koyomimonogatari:
* Episodes 01-06 [Commie](https://nyaa.si/view/1246528) (seems to be based on Sajamba from what I compared, revised + Better Typesetting)
* Episodes 07-12 [Sajamba](https://nyaa.si/view/835714)
* (optional but it's very short) [Koyomi History](https://nyaa.si/view/1141750) -- short "story" included in the BD of Koyomimonogatari to be watched/read after Koyomimonogatari.
		
		
9. ## Owarimonogatari: [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1163284) (has Commie subs)
	 * or [Commie's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/1011605) | Note: Commie's release is missing one font that you can patch in with this [patch](https://commiesubs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/owari_patches.zip).


10. ## Owarimonogatari S2: 
* The best video that you can easily obtain is probably [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1137467) | but the included subs are outdated, so get [StoryTime]'s subs for EPs 1-2 from [here](https://kitsunekko.net/subtitles/Owarimonogatari%20S02%20(2017)/[Storytime]%20Owarimonogatari%20(Ge)%20Mayoi%20Hell%20subs.rar) and use it with Kawaiika-Raws.
* EPs 3-7 subs can be taken from [ToishY], though not ideal, it is the best out there for the rest of [Owari2](https://mega.nz/file/07oRGYTJ#DKxB9zKqVj4X_LzHwIU0mcw4ZWW2VMppkMwkNugsHWg)
			
 * If you're lazy just get EPs 1&2 from [StoryTime](https://nyaa.si/view/1231415) and the rest from [ToishY'a release from here](https://nyaa.si/view/1178566), but their video is likely noticeably inferior to Kawaiika-Raws.


11. ## Zoku Owarimonogatari:

Three subs choices:
* If you're not lazy get [Kawaiika-Raws]((https://nyaa.si/view/1134728)) and use Edo's subs with it from [here](https://kitsunekko.net/subtitles/Zoku%20Owarimonogatari/[Edo]%20Zoku%20Owarmonogarai.rar)
* [Edo](https://nyaa.si/user/EdoPhantom?f=0&c=0_0&q=zoku) (same person who did Kizu, I prefer this script)
* [Kawaiika-Raws](https://nyaa.si/view/1134728) has MTBB subs -- MTBB's TL notes if [you're interested](https://pastebin.com/JnQSCG9M)
* [MTBB's original release](https://nyaa.si/view/1138570) (can't go wrong with it, I just like Edo's prose). I know it's 720p but if you run an okay upscaler with MPV it'll look close to the best (Kawaiika-Raws). For more info on upscaling with mpv, check [this blogpost](https://iamscum.wordpress.com/guides/videoplayback-guide/mpv-conf/) after installing [MPV-Made-Easy](https://github.com/Moodkiller/MPV-Made-Easy) or any other version of the software.

**AGAIN, IF THE RELEASE YOU DOWNLOADED HAS A FONTS FOLDER, DON'T FORGET TO INSTALL THE FONTS FROM IT!**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***Final note: 
If you get confused, it's alright to take the release from the full [compilation](https://nyaa.si/view/1160744)
but not all of them have the best subs so that might be a problem. Make sure to follow the watch order!
